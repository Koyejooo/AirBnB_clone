<h1>0x00. AirBnB clone - The console</h1>
<https://github.com/Koyejooo/AirBnB_clone/issues/1#issue-1702497457>
<h3>This is the first phase of a project to build a full web application based on a clone of the AirBnB website.
The first phase involves building most of the back-end utilities with Python. Some of which include:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A command interpreter console that uses the <code>cmd</code> module.</li>
<li>A parent class called <code>BaseModel</code> that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes as well as handle initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances.</li>
<li>An initial abstracted file storage engine for the project.</li>
</ol>
